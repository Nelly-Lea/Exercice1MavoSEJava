## Description
This Java project showcases a three-dimensional scene featuring various geometric bodies and luminous rays. The central element of our project is an abstract scene, with the focal point being a diamond constructed from multiple triangles, elegantly positioned on a reflective surface.

## Goals of this project 
- Software Engineering Principles
- Implement model-based development techniques for creating and manipulating 3D objects
- Object-Oriented Design (OOD) Principles
- Perform operations on 3D vectors to manipulate the position and orientation of geometric bodies
- Develop algorithms for creating, transforming, and rendering various geometric bodies
- Framework Construction in 3D
- Test-Driven Development (TDD)

## Project Improvements
We have introduced two enhancements to the project:

- Glossy Surface and Diffuse Glass:
  Implemented a feature to simulate a glossy surface and diffuse glass effect. This enhancement introduces a subtle blurring of reflections on a mirror surface, adding a touch of realism to the visual representation.

- Adaptive Supersampling:
  Incorporated adaptive supersampling to refine the edges of geometric bodies. This improvement reduces pixelation, providing a smoother and clearer appearance to the contours of objects within the 3D scene.

These enhancements aim to elevate the visual quality and realism of the 3D scene, offering a more immersive and polished experience for users.
